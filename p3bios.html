            <h2>Jonathan Eng</h2>
            <p>Jon is fairly new to the team, but what he lacks in experience, he makes up for in enthusiasm! He is constantly bugging his partner, Laura, to practice with him. On particularly lucky days, she obliges!</p>

            <h2>Laura Silverman</h2>
            <p>Laura is one of the most accomplished members of the team, twice stunning the Singles leagues by moving from the Consolation Bracket into the Winners Bracket. Laura found improved success with her addition of glasses and now preaches the power of sharp vision for shuffleboard matches. Who knew??</p>

            <img src="p3images/shufflewoman.png" alt="Team Member 3">
            <h2>Karla Baumler</h2>
            <p>Karla is another heavy hitter for team Shuffle N' Flow, bringing her unique blend of casual focus to the game. She can quickly run up the score on opponents but also throw in the unexpected Kitchen shot to keep things exciting. Can't tell which one of us is Karla? Just look up.</p>

            <h2>Jimmy</h2>
            <p>Jimmy loves shuffleboard strategy and often nerds out over it. He has a baseball background and will often use hand signals to communicate his thoughts. The only problem? None of us know what he's signaling. That's OK. We appreciate his enthusiasm.</p>
