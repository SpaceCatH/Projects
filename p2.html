    <h1>The Shuffleboard Team Page</h1>
    <p>When I joined bswift, the company was well-established but maintained its start-up spirit. This meant the role required a lot of hands-on, learn-by-doing experiences, which I loved! One of the most fun aspects was learning and deploying basic HTML for displaying information on the benefits site. This experience piqued my interest in HTML and front-end development. During my time away, I spent a couple of weeks speeding through Meta's courses on Coursera and practiced by creating the page linked below.</p> 
    <p id="question"><b>But why shuffleboard, you ask?</b></p>
    <p>My partner, Laura, introduced me to shuffleboard several months ago. Yes, it's that game that typically older folks play on the decks of cruise ships. At first, I thought the goal was just to slide the "biscuits" into the point areas to score as many points as possible. What I learned after playing several matches was that this is actually a much deeper strategic experience, kind of like Chess. An opponent can easily knock off one of your scored biscuits, so you instead need to find ways of hiding behind other biscuits.</p> 
    <p>Me being a thinker, this game immediately grabbed my attention, so it comes as no surprise that I would begin my coding practice by building a page for our league team.</p>
    <p>It is a pretty basic page so far, but I intend to fix it up once I have some ideas and more experience. <b><u>I'm still new at this!</u></b> Some things to notice:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I added a cool transition page at the front.</li>
        <li>There's a calculator function which tallies the total matches played, which doesn't really make sense, but it works!</li>
        <li>I created a Question of the Day function at the bottom which randomizes questions.</li>
        <li>There is an embedded link to a separate HTML page of team bios.</li>
        <li>The Bios page includes "cards" with shading around the edges.</li>
    </ul>
