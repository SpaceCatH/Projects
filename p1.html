    <h1>The Random Benefits Enrollment Project</h1>
    <p>One of the first projects I worked on was building a simple Benefits Enrollment experience within Google Sheets. Why did I do it?</p>
    <ol>
        <li>I wanted to give myself a ben-admin-related challange.</li>
        <li>I wanted to explore the idea of simplifying the enrollment experience.</li>
        <li>I didn't want to pay for Microsoft Excel. Google Sheets is free!</li>
        <li>I wanted to stretch my creative legs.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now, this of course doesn't replace more powerful ben admin platforms, but think about how interesting it is that this could be built entirely on a <u>FREE</u> platform. Small businesses need a quick/easy mechanism for recording enrollments? Easy. Other industries needing basic calculations with dependencies and clean interface? No problem!</p>
        <p>Looking back, this works better when transferred into a web-based experience, but I hadn't learned that at the time. Now that I have taken Meta courses in front-end development, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this is absolutely a possibility.</p>
