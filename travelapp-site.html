  <h1>Stamp’d</h1>
  <p><strong>Stamp’d</strong> is a mobile app that helps travelers plan, organize, and share packing lists and trip details with ease.</p>

  <h2>Email Use</h2>
  <p>
    Stamp’d allows users to email their own trip summaries and packing lists to themselves or a few chosen contacts.
    Each email is generated automatically from the trip data they’ve created in the app and sent only when the user requests it.
  </p>
  <p>
    All emails are <strong>user-initiated and transactional</strong> — never promotional or bulk messages.
    The app does not send newsletters, marketing emails, or unsolicited content.
  </p>

  <h2>Privacy and Delivery</h2>
  <p>
    Stamp’d uses <strong>Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)</strong> to handle secure and reliable delivery.
    Bounce and complaint notifications are managed through <strong>Amazon SNS</strong> to maintain high email quality.
  </p>
  <p>
    The app does not store or share recipient information beyond what’s required to send the requested email.
  </p>

  <h2>Developer</h2>
  <p>
    Stamp’d is developed by <strong>Jonathan Eng</strong>, an independent software developer focused on creating simple, user-centered travel tools.
